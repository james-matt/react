In this section we are setting up the machine using free open source software.

Video 4 - Installing VSCode

Install Node - JS on server

Node.js

We are going to use it to make a web server later.

Tools that use Node:
- webpack

node -v // version
npm -v // version (installed with node)

npm and yarn do the same thing as far as grabbing dependencies.

npm install -g yarn

global - installs on the machine for command line

yarn --version

Windows needs to restart.
