How does react render to the string?
JSX

How do I setup a quick web server to start using react?

/project_folder
    /public
        /index.html

What does index.html need to have?
<!DOCTYPE html> - defines html5 markup
<html>
<head>
<body>
<meta charset="UTF-8" /> - inside head defines character set to utf-8.
<title> - in head

How do I run these files and see changes as they are made?
Install live server
yarn global add live-server
Run live server
live-server public
That runs the public folder.
